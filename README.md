# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! In this project, I've created a fun and interactive game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Experience the classic hand game in a digital format, where you can make your choice and challenge the computer to see who comes out victorious. The user interface is designed with HTML and styled with CSS, while the game logic is powered by JavaScript. Feel free to clone the repository, open the `index.html` file in your browser, and enjoy playing the game. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!
